**Step One (or Where's My Soul?)**

Busy, busy, busy!

There
is always something to do. Filling time is not challenging. I can sort through my mail (or not, as I generally choose to do). I can run errands. I can do laundry. I can exercise. I can look at dog rescue websites and contemplate what it would mean to have a dog again, even though I'm gone all day and my walls are a fresh paint of white. I can go to the market. I can do that assignment I told my boss I'd do over the weekend. I can hop onto free online courses and learn to code in Ruby. And now, I can even [Kondo][0]\* my house if I find that I have five hours to kill. And if I'm not doing something, then I better get a move on or I will go into a panic and possibly die.

I think this is an
argument for quantity over quality and it was failing me because I fell for it and was exhausted.

Missing something, I knew there was another perspective, another take on this
life of mine that I wasn't seeing.  If I kept on at my wild attempts at
salvation and perfection, I would become a jerry-rigged soul, comprised of
Facebook memes, sections of books I'd read, advice from friends and foes,
magazine articles, TED Talks, Brene Brown (whom I love by the way), Soul Sundays, and wild machinations that I came up with all on
my own. I needed to pull the Andon cord to notify management that there was a process error in my soul.  I needed help. I came to the terrifying realization that if I didn't stop, my entire life
would go by and I would have rushed through it. 

But how does one stop to take an inventory?

**Meditation. **

While I had meditated
before, it was self-taught and, as I learned later, not even remotely what I was going
for.  My "meditation" was a cornucopia of techniques I'd read
about, and a session of meditation, for me, meant a tight-jawed attempt to think
of nothing ("clear the mind") and it usually ended in snoring brought
on by meditation-induced exhaustion.  

So I
enrolled in a beginning meditation class at [Insight LA ][1]\*\* in Santa Monica. I learned, first, how to meditate. I definitely had been doing it wrong. It turns out that you aren't supposed to
think of nothing and you aren't supposed to hyperventilate which was good news for me.

I also
learned that I'm not insane, that the monotony and mutiny of my mind is a
common phenomenon. Meditation was Step One on my journey to
stopping. It laid the foundation to allow me to stand back and look at my life like a Queen surveilling her empire from the top of a mountain. It is showing me my soul, one breath at a time.

\* _To
be perfectly honest, when I Kondo'd my room, my life did change a little for
the better. I highly recommend it.
Fortunately I have a teeny house so it shouldn't take me more than the
prescribed 6 months to Kondo my entire house. The garage terrifies me though. I need courage._

_\*\* If you are new to meditation or want to learn, I also recommend the [Insight Timer ][2]App.  _
