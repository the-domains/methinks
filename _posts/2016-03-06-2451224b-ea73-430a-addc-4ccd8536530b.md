Where's My Soul Anyway?

I'd spent much too long in agony, desperately preoccupied to mitigate the preoccupation of pretending to be confident and sane. But even more, I'd really been in a type of agony as far back as I could remember.  I was never good enough, smart enough, pretty enough, or just enough.  

I grew tired of the fight and was learning that maybe I wasn't fighting with the right tools or the tools I used before weren't working anymore. Maybe it wasn't meant to be a fight at all.  I had spent a lifetime fighting something. Conquering and becoming better was my only definition of success.  But better than what? Conquering what?

I was missing something. I knew there was another perspective, another take on this life of mine that I wasn't seeing.  If I kept on at my wild attempts at salvation and perfection, I would become a jerry-rigged soul, comprised of Facebook memes, sections of books I'd read, advice from friends and foes, magazine articles, and wild machinations that I came up with all on my own. I needed to pull the andon cord and take an inventory.

**Meditation. **I enrolled in a beginning meditation class at [Insight LA][0] in Santa Monica.  While I had meditated before, it was self-taught and as I learned, not even remotely what I was going for.  My "meditation" was a cornucopia of techniques I'd read about, and a session of meditation, for me, meant a tight-jawed attempt to think of nothing ("clear the mind") and it usually ended in snoring brought on by meditation-induced exhaustion.  

You know the book 'The Missing Piece' by Shel Silverstein? I have a copy of it on my living room table because it reminds me that I, just as I, am enough.  I've always hoped to get to that place.  What I learned at Insight LA brought me closer. I learned that I'm not insane, that the monotony and mutiny of my mind is a common phenomenon.  I learned that meditation has nothing to do with "thinking of nothing".  One of the most valuable lessons I learned, and certainly the lifeline I needed thrown my way at that moment, was that emotions move through us. They don't climb into your spleen, build a house, and procreate. Instead they pass through, on a visit. One night in class we meditated on emotions.  This was dangerous territory for me at the time and I was concerned that I would break into full sobs and roll into a fetal position, but I didn't.  I felt the emotion, tears gently fell down my cheeks, and, I swear to you, with all the pragmatism that guides me: the sadness lifted. I felt it lift. It was as if it just needed to be seen, perhaps waved to, and given a nod of respect.  I saw it and then it took off to visit the next poor sap. 

This doesn't mean that meditation cures all ills. The sadness returned, again and again, and it lifted, again and again.  But meditation taught me how to stop and look both ways and inside. It is showing me my soul, one breath at a time.
