## The Year of Stopping Dangerously

When he left, I didn't feel it immediately. It was agreed upon mutually that we would go our separate ways. But as the weeks passed, what began as a feeling of holding my breath transformed into a realization that all I thought I knew about myself, about life, no longer held. I stumbled this way and that, hoping I would stumble upon the right path. I began seeing a nutritionist, doctors, went to church, read books (shelves of them), hired a life coach.  I searched out anyone who might tell me how to get rid of the terrible sensation that I was sinking. I thought if only I could find the root cause, then I could fix it. If I worked hard enough, everything would be fine.

One day I woke too exhausted to make it to my early morning appointment.  My insides were itching, frustrated because there was no place else to turn or at least, I was out of ideas. I was directionless, a state that was terrifying, lonely, desperate, and peaceful. I was out of tricks.  As Dorothy said to the Wizard, "I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me."  

So I stopped. I stopped the frantic searches to heal myself. I stopped wishing. I stopped needing. I stopped worrying. I stopped late night texting. I stopped wanting. I lay there that morning, stared blankly at the ceiling, took a deep breath, and said out loud, "Okay God, I guess it's time to introduce myself to myself."

This blog is about what happened next.  It's about what I've learned and what I'm still learning.  It is not meant to be preachy and it may provide absolutely no value to anyone, except myself.   I'm truly a work in progress but, for the first time in my life, joy (real joy) has found it's way in every now and then.
