## The Year of Stopping Dangerously

When he left, I didn't feel it immediately. It was agreed upon mutually that we would go our separate ways. But as the weeks passed, what began as a feeling of holding my breath transformed into a realization that all I thought I knew about myself, about life, no longer held. I stumbled this way and that, hoping I would stumble upon the right path. I began seeing a nutritionist, doctors, went to church, read books (shelves of them).  I searched out anyone who might tell me how to get rid of the terrible sensation that I was sinking. I thought if only I could find the root cause, then I could fix it. If I worked hard enough, everything would be fine.

One day I woke too exhausted to get out of bed.  My insides were itching, frustrated because there was no place else to turn or at least, I was out of ideas. I was directionless, a state that was terrifying, lonely, desperate, and peaceful. I was out of tricks.  As Dorothy said to the Wizard, "I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me."  

So I stopped. I stopped the frantic searches to heal myself. I stopped wishing. I stopped needing. I stopped worrying. I stopped late night texting. I stopped wanting. And I must tell you, it's been miraculous. 

This blog is about what happened next.  It's about what I've learned and what I'm still learning.  It is not meant to be preachy and it may provide absolutely no value to anyone, except myself.  Hoorah for blogs that nobody reads!
