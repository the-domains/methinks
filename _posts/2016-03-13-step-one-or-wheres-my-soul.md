Step One (or Where's My Soul?)

I'd
spent much too long in agony, desperate to mitigate the preoccupation of
pretending to be confident and sane. But even more, I'd really been in a type
of agony as far back as I could remember.  I was never good enough, smart
enough, pretty enough, or just enough.  And to take care of that, I kept
very busy, all the time, for my entire life.

I even viewed sleep as an annoying requirement to staying alive. There
is always something to do and I thought that if I kept doing things, then I
would become better.

It's really an
argument for quantity over quality and it was failing me. 

Filling time is not challenging. I can sort
through my mail (or not, as I generally choose to do). I can run errands. I can
do laundry. I can exercise. I can look at dog rescue websites and contemplate
what it would mean to have a dog again, even though I'm gone all day and my
walls are a fresh paint of white. I can go to the market. I can do that
assignment I told my boss I'd do this weekend. And now, I can even [Kondo][0]\* my house if I find that I have five
hours to kill. And if I'm not doing
something, then I better get a move on or I will go into a panic and possibly
die.

It was
becoming obvious to me that I was going about things wrong. I was 45 when this became news to me and had spent
my entire life exhausted.

Missing something, I knew there was another perspective, another take on this
life of mine that I wasn't seeing.  If I kept on at my wild attempts at
salvation and perfection, I would become a jerry-rigged soul, comprised of
Facebook memes, sections of books I'd read, advice from friends and foes,
magazine articles, TED Talks, and wild machinations that I came up with all on
my own. I needed to pull the Andon cord to notify management that I was a process error.  I needed help. I actually came to the terrifying realization that if I didn't stop, my entire life
would go by and I wouldn't have done a damn thing that I really wanted to
do.

But how does one take an inventory?

**Meditation. **

While I had meditated
before, it was self-taught and, as I learned later, not even remotely what I was going
for.  My "meditation" was a cornucopia of techniques I'd read
about, and a session of meditation, for me, meant a tight-jawed attempt to think
of nothing ("clear the mind") and it usually ended in snoring brought
on by meditation-induced exhaustion.  

So I
enrolled in a beginning meditation class at [Insight LA ][1]in Santa Monica. I learned, first, how to meditate. I definitely had been doing it wrong. It turns out that you aren't supposed to
think of nothing and you aren't supposed to hyperventilate which was good news for me.

I also
learned that I'm not insane, that the monotony and mutiny of my mind is a
common phenomenon.  Meditation was Step One in my journey to
stopping. It laid the foundation and
what's come out of it is perplexing, sometimes shocking, and genuinely sort of
magical. It is showing me my soul, one breath at a time.

\* To
be perfectly honest, when I Kondo'd my room, my life did change a little for
the better. I highly recommend it.
Fortunately I have a teeny house so it shouldn't take me more than the
prescribed 6 months to Kondo my entire house. The garage terrifies me though. I need courage.
