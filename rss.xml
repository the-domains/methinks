            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Year of Stopping Dangerously</h1><p>When he left, I didn't feel it immediately. It was agreed upon mutually that we would go our separate ways. But as the weeks passed, what began as a feeling of holding my breath transformed into a realization that all I thought I knew about myself, about life, no longer held. I stumbled this way and that, hoping I would stumble upon the right path. I began seeing a nutritionist, doctors, went to church, read books (shelves of them).  I searched out anyone who might tell me how to get rid of the terrible sensation that I was sinking. I thought if only I could find the root cause, then I could fix it. If I worked hard enough, everything would be fine.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/816f42c97d9298b2207d8f51f07f0a83dfd1f547.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>LAPD Headquarters DTLA</h1><p>“Have you been under stress lately?” This was my doctor’s first question, a question that I expected. Many doctor visits are generally due to stress and I’d learned that most of mine are too. I knew this dance. Sometimes I would pre-empt his questions by saying: “Dr. G, I’m in hell right now so it’s very likely that the reason I think I have liver cancer is due to stress, but, I think I have liver cancer. Can you just confirm that I don’t so I can go on my way?”</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/808ca429ca248e7f4fc67c54b0e84ad6e170449e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
